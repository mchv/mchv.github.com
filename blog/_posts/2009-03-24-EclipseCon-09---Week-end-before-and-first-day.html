We arrived with Cedric Friday night in Silicon Valley. Flight trip was an opportunity to try <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swtbot/">SWTBot</a> and look at current <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=269609">GEF Support</a>.<br /><br />Saturday morning we decided to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex">the Googleplex</a>.

Apple store was an occasion to admire their laptops and ask a seller some facts to convince our Boss that our productivity will increase with them :)<br /><br />On Sunday we went to Berkeley university, where we met sociable squirrels !<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/SciW755SInI/AAAAAAAAAHA/1vnz-msAVtM/s1600-h/squirrel.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 133px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/SciW755SInI/AAAAAAAAAHA/1vnz-msAVtM/s200/squirrel.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5316665316008403570" /></a><br /><br />First day of EclipseCon was a lot of fun. There seems to be less people than last year but people are still friendly and enthusiasts.<br /><br />At morning I attended Ketan great <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009/sessions?id=288">SWTBot tutorial</a>, which was successful as room was filled to the brim.<br /><br />At the end of afternoon <a href="http://www.acceleo.org">Acceleo</a> "Best Open Source Eclipse-Based Developer Tool" <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20090323_AwardsWinners.php">award</a> was the pleasantly surprise. Thanks for the community for this great recognition of our work at <a href="http://www.obeo.fr">Obeo</a> !
