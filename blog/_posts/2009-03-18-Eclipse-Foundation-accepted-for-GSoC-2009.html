Despite economic crisis, Google renews its awesome summer of code program in 2009. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://code.google.com/soc"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 200px;" src="http://code.google.com/images/2009socwithlogo.gif" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://model-driven-blogging.blogspot.com/2009/03/eclipse-modeling-summer-of-code-2009.html">CÃ©dric</a> and <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2009/03/13/soc-what-are-you-doing-this-summer/">Ian</a> already blogged about it, but it is now official for Eclipse , we have been  <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2009">accepted as mentoring organization</a>.<br /><br />Students,  Eclipse is a great open-source organization with various projects,  have a look at the current <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2009_Ideas">ideas page</a> !<br /><br />I will present more in detail "Acceleo and ATL combine" proposal.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/m2t/?project=acceleo">Eclipse Acceleo (previously named MTL) project</a> provides an implementation and a development toolkit for the OMG MOF Model to Text Language.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/m2m/atl/">Eclipse ATL project</a> provides an implementation and a development toolkit for the ATLAS Transformation language. <br /><br />Project idea is to work on combination of this 2 powerful technologies. On Acceleo side, it means being able in a template to call a model-to-model (m2m) transformation, for instance to improve readeability of a template. On ATL side, it means being able in a transformation to "serialize" model information, for instance to do some reporting.<br /><br />Implementation should be made without high coupling between ATL and Acceleo as far as possible, in order to support in future other m2m languages, such as OMG QVT.  <br /><br />Hope you will find it interesting !
