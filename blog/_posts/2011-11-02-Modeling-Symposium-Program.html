<br />As <a href="http://mariot-thoughts.blogspot.com/2011/10/modeling-symposium.html">previously announced</a> there will be an exciting modeling symposium during EclipseCon Europe.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2VWfKGYB3ek/TqLfYtZu-zI/AAAAAAAAAV4/Y7F4Tf1UD7g/s1600/sympo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="219" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2VWfKGYB3ek/TqLfYtZu-zI/AAAAAAAAAV4/Y7F4Tf1UD7g/s320/sympo.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Thursday, November 3rd</span><br />&nbsp; <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"> from 18:30 to 20:30<br />Silchersaal</span></div><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><ul><li>Xtext 2.1 by <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/users/76">Sven Efftinge</a><br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://www.eclipsecon.org/sites/default/files/pictures/picture-76.png" /><br /><br />&nbsp; Xtext 2.1 allows to define languages for the JVM by just implementing two simple scripts.<br />In this short demo, I'll show an example of using this new API. You'll see what these scripts are about <br />and how awesome the the resulting language and its IDE support is.<br /><br /> </li><li>&nbsp;OCL by <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/users/292">Ed Willlink</a><br /><br /><img border="0" height="100" src="http://www.eclipsecon.org/submissions/2011/callbacks/show_image.php?PersonID=ewillink" width="81" /> <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The evolution of the MDT/OCL project from Java-only model support to an<br />OCL IDE will be briefly described. The extensive use of Acceleo and Xtext<br />for auto-generation of both Eclipse OCL and the OMG OCL specification will<br />be outlined. Finally the OCL 2 Java code generator will be announced<br />eliminating parsing costs at run-time and accelerating execution by one to<br />two orders of magnitude<br /><br /></li></ul><ul><li style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">Acceleo Interpreter by <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/users/39">Stéphane Bégaudeau</a> <br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://www.eclipsecon.org/sites/default/files/pictures/picture-39.png" /><br /><br />&nbsp; I would start by the presentation of the new Acceleo interpreter  view with its different features. I'll show how it can be used to  execute OCL queries on EMF based models. Then I'll highlight its  integration with Acceleo by using it combined with the Acceleo debugger.  Finally, I'll explain how this view, that has strictly speaking, no  dependencies with Acceleo can be used by other projects with a small  example of its use without Acceleo to support another language.<br /><br /></li><li>.EMF-IncQuery by <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/users/68">István Ráth</a><br /><br />&nbsp; This presentation introduces EMF-IncQuery, a declarative and scalable EMF model query framework. EMF-IncQuery uses a graph query language, and provides incremental query evaluation by caching the results of the model queries and incrementally maintaining the cache when the underlying EMF model changes. Furthermore, the EMF-IncQuery framework can be easily integrated into existing EMF-based applications in a non-intrusive way. During the talk, we quickly overview how easy it is to define and integrate highly scalable model queries into existing EMF-based applications, in the form of a very short live demonstration using the MDT Papyrus modeling tool. The scalability of the engine will also be demonstrated, with on-the-fly constraint revalidation that takes less than 100 milliseconds over large AUTOSAR models with over 1 million elements.<br /><br /><br /> </li><li>EMF Store Demo by <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/users/205">Maximilian Koegel</a><br /><br /><img border="0" src="http://www.eclipsecon.org/sites/default/files/pictures/picture-205.jpg" /><br /><br />&nbsp; EMFStore is a model repository for EMF and allows to collaboratively<br />edit EMF models and keep a version history. EMFStore can be integrated<br />into EMF-based RCP applications to provide the application with its<br />capabilities. In this demo we will show an industrial customer application where EMFStore was integrated and inspect the code that was required to do so.<br /><br /><br /> </li><li>EMF Profiles by <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/users/108">Hugo Brunelière</a><br /><br /><img src="http://www.eclipsecon.org/sites/default/files/pictures/picture-108.png" /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Have you ever been in a situation in which you would like to annotate an  EMF model with additional information, but the last thing you wanted to  do was to change its metamodel to made that possible? I bet the answer  is yes for almost anybody that has been using EMF for a while. In this talk I will present&nbsp; EMF Profiles a solution inspired from UML Profiles which provide a light-weight model annotation mechanism.<br /><br />  </li><li>MPS by <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/users/148">Markus Völter</a><br /><br /><img height="100" src="http://www.voelter.de/pictures/me/markusvoelter0t.png" width="65" /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; JetBrains MPS is a powerful language workbench available under the Apache 2.0 license. It uses projectional editing, so it supports quite flexible syntax as well as language modularization and composition. Best of all, the development roadmap include an integration with Eclipse in the context of version 3.0. In this slot, I will give you a short demo of what MPS can do.</li></ul><br />Hope to see you there !<br />If you would like to be included in this program, please <a href="mailto:mariot.chauvin@obeo.fr;ed.merks@gmail.com;b.kolb@kolbware.de?subject=[EclipseCon%20Europe%20Modeling%20Symposium]">contact us</a> .<br /><ul></ul><ul><br /></ul><ul><br /></ul><ul><br /></ul>
