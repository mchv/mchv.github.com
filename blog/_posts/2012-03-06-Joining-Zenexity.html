Joining a new company, is a great adventure. By meeting new people and  working on different projects, you learn new things and discover other  ways of doing things. This leads to impassioned discussions and  knowledge sharing. On my side, I am starting to dig deeper into Scala. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RiPh-xWk4tI/T1D0ee8mjVI/AAAAAAAAAdU/crBTQUMkHDE/s1600/SaclaBook.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RiPh-xWk4tI/T1D0ee8mjVI/AAAAAAAAAdU/crBTQUMkHDE/s320/SaclaBook.jpg" width="239" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Zenexity is the company who created the <a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play framework</a>,  a java web framework, which as you probably know, drops the craziness  complexity of JEE to focus on simplicity.&nbsp; <br /><br />In a recent <a href="http://blog.mchv.me/2011/11/collaborative-modeling-eclipsecon.html">presentation</a>, I have spoken about collaboration. I notably mentioned that in the last five years applications and medias&nbsp;which integrate <i>natively</i> collaboration have known impressive success. Looking at collaboration is interesting, as it exhibits today web application concerns.<br /><br /><i>Integration of multiple data sources</i><br /><br />Enabling collaboration means dealing with several data producers. Typically, for each you will have a connection, and one of the application responsibility will be to manage those connections. The management becomes harder when the number of producer raises. For instance, the application may reach a connections number limit, so in order to scale the application will need to detect idle producers for closing temporally their connection.<br /><br /><i>Dealing with large amout of data</i><br /><br />When you add more potential data producer, this generally ends with more information to manage or at least more information you would like to store, for instance for statistics purpose. To achieve scalability you may choose a non relational database. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i></i><br /><br /><i>Realtime interactions</i><br /><br />To ease collaboration, you need to provide a way for users to interact between them. Basically each user should be able to send notifications to others, directly or indirectly, and to do it efficiently traditional polling is not efficient.<br /><br />The new <a href="http://www.playframework.org/2.0">coming release</a> of Play tends to tackle those concerns. It will  provide <a href="https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/Iteratees">powerful</a> <a href="https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/Enumerators">abstractions</a> which will enables you to write simply reactive web  applications. Applications which, integrate multiple data sources, support multiple data stores, and could use&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/JavaWebSockets">efficient bidirectional communications</a>.
