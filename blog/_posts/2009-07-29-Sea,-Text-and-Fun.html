I spent last week-end in La baule, having fun to swim, play football and read on the beach.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/Sm7Q1PONpFI/AAAAAAAAAIk/260hFcTPhAw/s1600-h/labaule.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 89px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/Sm7Q1PONpFI/AAAAAAAAAIk/260hFcTPhAw/s400/labaule.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5363453819282629714" border="0" /></a></div><span style="font-style: italic;">Photo from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/burgermac/">Burgermac</a></span><br /><br />Speaking about books, I recently finished to read the great book from Robert C. Martin, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>. One really interesting chapter, is about comments and how they could be dangerous.<br /><br />I will not speak here about javadoc and API documentation, but all other comments which are used to add tasks (TODO, FIXME), explain an hack or anything else.<br /><br />The main difficulty is to keep them in sync with the code. As they are not linked to the code they refer, they may move with code addition/refactoring or become inaccurate if the implementation change.  Another leak from these comments is that it is difficult to retrieve the author, or to start a discussion from one of them.<br /><br />In fact, as this kind of comments are meta-data, it could be more logical to dissociate them from code, I mean to store them outside of the code.<br />We do it of issue tracking (and sometime for tasks), but then comes the problem of integration between tools.<br /><br />In the last version of OpenOffice, notes are displayed in the margin. I find it very usable.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.0/images/Notes_small-1.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 223px; height: 117px;" src="http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.0/images/Notes_small-1.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />So here is a quick mockup, of what I would like to have for this kind of comments.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/SnA8Mv6_WBI/AAAAAAAAAIs/lbl-RMiCNkg/s1600-h/mockup.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 115px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/SnA8Mv6_WBI/AAAAAAAAAIs/lbl-RMiCNkg/s400/mockup.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5363853345918244882" border="0" /></a>
