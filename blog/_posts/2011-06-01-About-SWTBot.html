I recently read a <a href="http://jmhofer.johoop.de/?p=185">blog post</a> about <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swtbot/">SWTBot</a>, which I consider as a <a href="http://ed-merks.blogspot.com/2011/03/universe-is-unfair.html">unfair</a> rant.<div><br />Before going further, I would like to say that I think having several eclipse projects with the same functionalities is totally fine. Diversity and competition enable one to bring innovation and new approaches. I think it, but I have also experienced it inside the modeling platform with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/">Acceleo</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/m2t/?project=jet#jet">Jet</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/m2t/?project=xpand">Xpand</a> or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/graphiti/">Grafiti</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/?project=gmf-runtime#gmf-runtime">GMF</a>. That said I think each project should concentrate on building a successful technology and an enthusiast community associated, and not trying to claim that other projects suck, more over when criticisms seem a bit peremptory.<br /><br />Below are my answers, point to point :<div><ul><li>I agree that support for other keyboard mappings could <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced;short_desc=keyboard;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED;bug_status=NEW;bug_status=ASSIGNED;bug_status=REOPENED;short_desc_type=allwordssubstr;component=SWTBot;product=SWTBot">be enhanced a lot</a> in SWTBot, but I do not think this issue is a blocker for functional testing your application in a majority of cases. Seriously, how many features depends on umlaut and trema in your text inputs ?</li></ul><ul><li>You may prefer <a href="http://testng.org/">TestNG</a>, but having support for this test framework is not mandatory for having SWTBot to work. However to complain about a feature request, never asked before, making SWTBot not usable, seems to me weird.</li></ul><ul><li>The comment above apply, but I will add that the issue you encounter seems to be rather in the scala eclipse integration plug-in than in SWTBot. Anyway it should be easy to fix.</li></ul><ul><li> I was not able to understand your problem and the what the trick you mention fixes. Please open an issue with steps to reproduce and the behavior you expect.</li></ul><div>May be you were trying to suggest cool new features, or priority in fixing issues, in that case do not hesitate to open bugzilla entries or add your comment to existing ones.</div><div><br /></div>SWTBot is a small project, with a dynamic community, which try to improve it step by step. It is certainly not perfect, had <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;product=SWTBot&amp;component=">issues</a> and room for improvement, but we try to make it work.</div></div>
