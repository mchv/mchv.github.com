4 years ago, I joined <a href="http://www.obeo.fr/">Obeo</a>, a startup focused on model driven engineering. At that time, I just finished my google <a href="http://eclipse-soc-mariot.blogspot.com/">summer of code</a> for Eclipse Foundation, and it was a nice opportunity to join a company involved in the eclipse community.&nbsp;Tomorrow, it will be my last day of that adventure, an adventure I have decided to leave for reasons I explain below.<br /><br />Obeo has been using Eclipse as <a href="http://model-driven-blogging.blogspot.com/2010/03/unusual-propulsion-system.html">unusual&nbsp;propulsion&nbsp;system</a>, we have benefited a lot from the eclipse platform and its modeling stack but we have tried to give back as much as we have received, creating a driving force.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-edDxjG3Jx6M/Trpg8W-57_I/AAAAAAAAAZo/zM9AkFrYWts/s1600/projects.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-edDxjG3Jx6M/Trpg8W-57_I/AAAAAAAAAZo/zM9AkFrYWts/s1600/projects.png" /></a></div><br />The people I have worked with at Obeo are brilliant. I am not writing that for the blog post, I really think it. You probably already know some of them (<a href="http://alagarde.tumblr.com/">Alex</a>, <a href="http://model-driven-blogging.blogspot.com/">Cedric</a>, <a href="http://modeldrivenblog.blogspot.com/">Fred</a>, <a href="http://eef-modeling.blogspot.com/">Goulwen</a>, <a href="http://eclipsemde.blogspot.com/">Laurent</a>, <a href="http://mdenutshell.blogspot.com/">Mikael</a>, <a href="http://sbegaudeau.tumblr.com/">Stephane</a>, <a href="http://williampiers.blogspot.com/">William</a>) involved in eclipse projects, I can tell you there are others doing awesome modeling stuffs. I will miss those guys.<br /><br />The first reason of my departure is that I feel like working on other topics.&nbsp;Before joining Obeo, I worked on various subjects, not modeling related and sometimes even not software engineering related. I like that diversity and I believe in the transversality of knowledge as well as in the&nbsp;strength&nbsp;of experience.<br /><br />The second one is the wish to take up new challenges. We took up several at the&nbsp;beginning of Obeo, in particular on the <a href="http://mariot-thoughts.blogspot.com/2011/09/modeling-20-lets-collaborate.html">project I was working on</a>,&nbsp;but, with the growth of the company,&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;to work on disruptive innovations became less frequent.<br /><br />I don't know yet how I will be involved in Eclipse in the future, so I would like to thank you Eclipse&nbsp;community, it has been a pleasure.
