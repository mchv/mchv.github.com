ESE is already over, and from this edition I would like to retain 3 things :<br /><ul><li><span style="font-size:130%;">Community is open and diverse</span> </li></ul><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/TNPBxzLg8EI/AAAAAAAAAL4/D6QDx-ZXfK4/s1600/community.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/TNPBxzLg8EI/AAAAAAAAAL4/D6QDx-ZXfK4/s320/community.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5535981428264726594" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192); font-style: italic;">Photo from </span><a style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192); font-style: italic;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nostri-imago/2948760912/">Cliff</a></span><br /></div><br />Eclipse is a community, and ESE is an awesome opportunity to meet in real life members of Eclipse community. I have found that the attendance was a good mix of committers, adopters and end users which lead to interesting discussion and feedback about projects and technologies. I have liked the accessibility and open mindedness of every person I met.<br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-size:130%;">Modeling is everywhere</span></li></ul><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/TNU3G3KwhgI/AAAAAAAAAMA/-H3Ik0TdIl8/s1600/modeling_logo.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 286px; height: 193px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/TNU3G3KwhgI/AAAAAAAAAMA/-H3Ik0TdIl8/s320/modeling_logo.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5536391907949708802" border="0" /></a><br /><br />It was impressive to see that people have understood that <span style="font-weight: bold;">modeling is not limited</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">UML </span>and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> code generation</span>.<br /><br />On a textual side <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext">Xtext</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo">Acceleo</a> were the 2 stars with a lot of talks presenting their functionalities or exemplary usage. There was also a <a href="http://mdenutshell.blogspot.com/2010/11/creating-android-application-with.html">tutorial</a> combining them to learn how to use these 2 great technologies to model and generate android applications.<br /><br />On graphical side, there were plenty of eye candy things to see. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/?project=eef">EEF</a> presentation from <a href="http://eef-modeling.blogspot.com/">Goulwen</a> showed how you could easily generate sexy properties and wizards for a metamodel. Mitra, a semi-automated model transformation tool, presentation showed  a 3D user interface where each model is displayed on a 2D plane. I am not sure this is scalable but it was a great demo of what's can be done with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef3d/">GEF3D</a>. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=papyrus">Papyrus</a> presentation showed the progress they have made in providing an UML (but not limited to it) reference graphical editor. <a href="http://www.bonitasoft.com/">Bonita Open Solution</a> presentation showed a very attractive and intuitive BPMN editor. In its presentation of modeling for <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">WTP</a>, <a href="http://www.mda4eclipse.com/">Etienne</a> showed briefly modelers build with <a href="http://obeo.fr/pages/obeo-designer/">Obeo Designer</a>, our DSL Studio on top of the eclipse modeling platform. Papyrus, Bonita Open Solution, and Obeo Designer relies on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/?project=gmf-runtime#gmf-runtime">GMF Runtime</a>. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/graphiti/">Graphiti</a> is a new alternative runtime, and its presentation was a demo of a beautiful library modeler. Last but not least and good transition, <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Dawn">Dawn</a> demo of collaborative edition between editors, including diagram ones was amazing.<br /><br />Model management <span style="font-weight: bold;">concerns</span> had a very good coverage this year.  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDO">CDO</a> is aimed at <span style="font-weight: bold;">scalability</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">sharing</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">storage</span> of models and <a href="http://thegordian.blogspot.com/">Eike</a> presentation about it was very comprehensive. The more I know about CDO, the more I find it well-designed.  <a href="http://cope.in.tum.de/pmwiki.php">COPE</a> focus on models<span style="font-weight: bold;"> migration</span> and its presentation pointed up the advanced tooling they provide to facilitate metamodel evolution.  <a href="http://emfstore.org/">EMF Store</a> is dedicated to models <span style="font-weight: bold;">storage</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">versioning</span>. It uses <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/?project=compare#compare">EMF Compare</a> for comparison and COPE for migration. A talk and a poster were presented.<br /><br />Other great stuffs were presented like collaboration of EMF and GWT for <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2010/sessions/?page=sessions&amp;id=1729">modeling in the cloud</a>, or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/sphinx/">Sphinx</a> an initiative to have a more coherent modeling platform.<br /><br />According to this the modeling symposium was a real success. Many talks on various topics  from different speakers. My only regret is that with such a crowd, it was a bit difficult to start a discussion just after a talk, but that's probably the price of fame.<br /><ul><li><span style="font-size:130%;">Build simplification is moving forward</span><br /></li></ul><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/TNa2_t6ANHI/AAAAAAAAAMI/qz8SNyInGFM/s1600/hammer.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_QqsJK1u1WXI/TNa2_t6ANHI/AAAAAAAAAMI/qz8SNyInGFM/s320/hammer.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5536813997669495922" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">Photo from </span><a style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(192, 192, 192);" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jolienvallins/1505871497/">jolien_vallins</a></span><br /></div><br />In past I had some headaches with eclipse build technologies. There are several approaches and several projects (PDE Build, <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Common_Build_Infrastructure">Athena</a>, <a href="http://www.pluginbuilder.org/">Pluginbuilder</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/buckminster/">Buckminster</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/b3/">B3</a>), but I think that the gap with them to create and maintain a build remains quite high. The demo I have seen from <a href="http://lenettoyeur-on-eclipse.blogspot.com/">Pascal</a> of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/">tycho</a>, let me think that it's a promising approach as I have found that it hides the complexity.<br /><br />Of course there was lot of other pretty cool talks and demos, like the <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2010/presenters/#Jeff_Norris">Jeff Noris</a> keynote, that you  missed if you weren't at ESE this year. See you next time !
